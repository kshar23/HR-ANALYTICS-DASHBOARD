# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
**Project Overview**:
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to identify key factors contributing to attrition and workforce trends. Using Power BI, I built an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard to transform raw employee records into meaningful business insights that support data-driven HR decision-making.
The dashboard enables HR teams to monitor attrition patterns, evaluate employee satisfaction levels, and understand the impact of salary, job role, and tenure on employee retention.

**Business Problem**:
Organizations often struggle with: High employee attrition
Lack of visibility into attrition drivers
Inefficient workforce planning
Limited data-backed HR decisions
This project aims to identify major attrition factors and provide actionable insights for improving employee retention strategies.

**Tools & Technologies Used**:
Power BI – Dashboard Development
DAX – KPI Creation & Calculations
Data Modeling – Relationship Building
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Data Visualization & Storytelling

**Key KPIs**:
Total Employees
Attrition Count
Attrition Rate (%)
Average Salary
Average Age
Average Years at Company

**Key Insights**:
Overall attrition rate identified at ~16%.
Higher attrition observed in lower salary slabs.
Certain job roles show significantly higher turnover.
Employees with lower job satisfaction levels are more likely to leave.
Early-career employees show higher attrition compared to long-tenure employees.

**Business Recommendations**:
Improve compensation strategy for lower salary brackets.
Focus on engagement programs for early-tenure employees.
Address satisfaction gaps in high-attrition job roles.
Implement targeted retention policies using data-driven insights.

**Project Impact**:
This project demonstrates the ability to:
Convert raw HR data into actionable business insights
Build dynamic and interactive dashboards
Use DAX for KPI creation
Apply data modeling techniques
Deliver data-driven recommendations
